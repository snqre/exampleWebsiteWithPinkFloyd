                <h1><a href="https://www.pinkfloyd.com">Pink Floyd Website</a></h1>
                <p>The website is great as it provides an insight into the band and whatever is left off it. The colours are used in a creative way where they do not clash with each other to make it sore on the naked eye. The cons of this website are that it does not accurately provide any information and there are no links to guide you along the website. There is very little detail about the actual activity and does not touch upon the history of the band.</p>
                <h1><a href="https://radiohead.com">Radiohead Website</a></h1>
                <p>The radiohead website is a mish mash of colours which really represents the kind of music they make. The website shows their famous songs and lets you access the songs through streaming applications. The cons of this website are that the website gives little to no detail about the band or their history. There are also little to no words to explain how to access the website or to find what you are actually looking for.</p>
